## Introduction  
The primary goal of these projects is to understand how machine learning models can be trained, imported, and utilized in iOS applications to deliver intelligent and interactive experiences. Each project focuses on a specific feature or problem domain to showcase different ML applications in iOS.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Core ML**: For integrating machine learning models into iOS apps.  
- **Vision**: For image analysis and object detection.  
- **Natural Language**: For text analysis and processing.  
- **Swift**: For application development.  

## Projects  

### 1. Image Classifier  
- **Description**: An app that identifies objects in images using a Core ML model.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Integrates a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNetV2).  
  - Utilizes Vision framework for image processing.  

### 2. Sentiment Analyzer  
- **Description**: An app that determines the sentiment of a given text input.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Implements Natural Language framework.  
  - Analyzes text and provides positive, neutral, or negative sentiment feedback.  

### 3. Custom Model Integration  
- **Description**: A demo app showcasing how to integrate and use a custom-trained ML model.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Converts a trained model to `.mlmodel`.  
  - Demonstrates how to handle model inputs and outputs in Swift.

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/ios-machine-learning-projects.git  
   ```  
2. Open the desired project folder.  
3. Open the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.  
4. Build and run the project on a simulator or a real device.  

## Future Plans  
- Implement real-time object detection using Vision and Core ML.  
- Explore on-device training capabilities.  
- Experiment with other ML frameworks like TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile.
